Saga Dataset Progress – 2025-10-16
==================================

Status
------
- Exported Stena raw slices (port calls, voyages, vessels, cargo, commodity) with modelling guardrails; stored under `DataSets/Raw/Stena/`.
- Captured SQL extracts in `DataSets/Raw/Stena/SQL/` for reproducibility.
- Terminal coverage remains sparse (≈98% null); fallback tiers will rely on port-level medians.

Row Counts
----------
- `port_calls_completed_asof_2025-12-31.csv`: 1,148 rows (10 columns) – includes terminal name when available.
- `voyages_completed_asof_2025-12-31.csv`: 1,206 rows (18 columns) – voyages completed by 31-Dec-2025 with valid distance/time metrics.
- `vessels_reference.csv`: 65 rows (14 columns) – active vessel master records with dimensions.
- `cargo_asof_2025-12-31.csv`: 476 rows (10 columns) – limited to voyages in scope; no load/discharge port IDs in this table.
- `commodity_reference.csv`: 31 rows (4 columns) – commodity lookup for enrichment.

Notes & Risks
-------------
- Terminal IDs are effectively missing; only 22 port calls supply a terminal_id despite the view join. Document in QA artefacts and solver fallbacks.
- Voyage export excludes legs with zero `DAYS_TOTAL_AT_SEA` or miles outside [20, 12,000]; revisiting thresholds may be needed if key voyages were filtered out.

Next Actions
------------
1. Parameterise `build_port_turnaround_dataset.py` to accept a customer slug (e.g., `--customer stena`) and read/write customer-specific folders.
2. Regenerate derived datasets and QA outputs for Stena once parameterisation is in place.
3. Update documentation/QA notes to highlight terminal missingness and voyage count differences vs Northern Lights.
